# Laravel Assignment

Welcome to the ARK (almost). This will be your guiding document to help you with your Laravel assignment.

## **Overview**

Part of the hiring process you're going through consists of evaluating your technical capabilities by means of this assignment. It will consist of the following phases:

### **The Assignment**

This should be no surprise, but you'll get an assignment that you will have to fulfill. You can do this at home, outside or any other location you fancy, as long as you get it done. You'll have **7 days** to finish the assignment unless agreed otherwise, as we believe that's a more than fair timeframe to get it done. You can find further details about the actual assignment in the **Assignment** section below.

### **Submission**

When you believe you're done with the assignment, or when you run out of time, you can send us a link to your repository on GitHub (or GitLab, BitBucket, etc) so we can check what you've accomplished. We'll go over your code, check your readme and follow the steps to set up your project as intended and to see it in action. Once we've gone over it, which will not take more than a few days, we will report our findings back to you. Depending on the quality of your assignment, we'll be giving you feedback to make certain improvements and give you time to incorporate these. Furthermore, we will have questions regarding the "why" of your application, e.g. why you chose a certain construct over another.

After possible changes have been incorporated, and any questions we have are answered, we'll do a final evaluation of your work.

Now on to the actual assignment (finally): we want you to create a simple blockchain explorer.

## **Assignment**

At ARK, our Laravel stack consists of [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com) and [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) in combination with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for our frontend aspects, which is also what we expect you to use for this assignment.

## **Expectations**

Our expectations will differ based on what your level of experience is and what position you are applying for. In general, we expect the application to work properly, without errors thrown when we are testing it during our assessment. We will also expect the app to be responsive, but you are free to decide for yourself what you believe to be sensible breakpoints for your application.

### **Functionality**

Regarding functionality, we expect your application to be able to perform the following tasks:

- ***List blocks and transactions from the ARK blockchain***
- ***Show detail pages for blocks and transactions***
- ***List wallets and corresponding transactions***
- ***Showing delegates and who a wallet is voting for***
- ***Switching between ARK Mainnet and ARK Devnet***
- ***User login and saving of user-preferences***
- ***Letting a user save his own wallets***

### **General Remarks**

- You will have to come up with a design for the application yourself.
*wink wink*: you can check out our other projects such as the [Explorer](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/explorer) to see what colors and general UX our projects contain and re-use elements where needed.
- API endpoints documentation can be found on [https://api.ark.dev/public-rest-api/endpoints](https://api.ark.dev/public-rest-api/endpoints)
- You can use [https://explorer.ark.io/api](http://explorer.ark.io/api) (ARK Mainnet) and [https://dexplorer.ark.io/api](http://dexplorer.ark.io/api) (ARK Devnet) for the API requests.
- Write unit, feature and e2e tests
- Provide a proper `README.md` with installation instruction and how to run your application
- Keep accessibility in mind
- Add guiding comments where relevant
- Proper Git practices
- Clean code
